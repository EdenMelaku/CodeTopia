# Code Style

This documentation provides some code style you have to follow to inorder for your branch be accebted and merged to the master branch. These code style guidlines are in addition to code styles outlined by python community in PEP8. Thus since every code will be tested against PEP8 using flake8, makem sure your code passes these tests in order for your pull request to recognised by the community.

## Characters

standard PEP8 uses 80 character as default, due to the setting.py module we used 100 character as default.
